# Angular-Learning
Learning Angular from scratch with small tasks.

Most frequent Commands:
-
-
    - ng new <project-name>: Creates a new Angular project with the specified name.
    - ng serve: Builds and serves the Angular application locally for development purposes. It launches a development server and automatically reloads the application when changes are made.
    - ng generate <schematic>: Generates different elements of an Angular application, such as components, services, modules, and more. Schematics are templates that help generate code quickly.
    - ng build: Builds the Angular application for production. It creates optimized bundles and prepares the app for deployment.
    - ng test: Runs unit tests for the Angular application using Karma and Jasmine. It helps ensure that the code behaves as expected.
    - ng lint: Analyzes the code for potential errors, code style violations, and other issues using a linter like ESLint or TSLint.
    - ng update: Updates the Angular dependencies and other packages used in the project to their latest versions. It helps keep the project up to date.
    - ng add <package-name>: Adds a new package or library to the Angular project. It automatically installs and configures the package, making it ready for use.
    - ng deploy: Deploys the Angular application to a hosting platform or a server for production use.
    - ng help: Displays help information and lists available commands and options provided by the Angular CLI.

Most frequent ng generate Commands:
    - ng generate component <component-name>: Generates a new component file with the specified name. Components are the building blocks of an Angular application and represent different parts of the user interface.
    - ng generate service <service-name>: Creates a new service file with the specified name. Services are used to encapsulate reusable business logic, data retrieval, and other operations that can be shared across multiple components.
    - ng generate module <module-name>: Generates a new module file with the specified name. Modules help organize the application into logical units and provide a way to encapsulate related components, services, and other features.
    - ng generate directive <directive-name>: Creates a new directive file with the specified name. Directives allow you to extend the behavior of HTML elements or create reusable custom attributes.
    - ng generate pipe <pipe-name>: Generates a new pipe file with the specified name. Pipes are used to transform data in Angular templates, allowing you to format, filter, or manipulate the displayed values.
    - ng generate class <class-name>: Creates a new TypeScript class file with the specified name. Classes are commonly used to define models, data structures, or other reusable entities.
    - ng generate interface <interface-name>: Generates a new TypeScript interface file with the specified name. Interfaces define contracts for objects and provide a way to enforce a specific structure or shape of data.
    - ng generate enum <enum-name>: Creates a new TypeScript enumeration file with the specified name. Enums are used to define a set of named constants, making it easier to work with predefined values.
